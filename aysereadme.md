# Project Proposal: Determining the Criteria for Numbering the Tracks in Taylor Swift's Albums

## Research Question:
What are the criteria for numbering the tracks on Taylor Swift’s albums?

## Abstract:
This research aims to determine whether the numbering of the tracks in the album is done according to any criterion, or a random order is made. Machine learning models can be used to predict the ranking of songs based on their qualities. When examining the sequence of the tracks, it is recommended to use the correlation analysis method to see if there is a strategic approach between the characteristics of danceability, energy, valence, etc.

## Introduction:
In the world of popular music, the order of tracks on an album is an important factor in defining the listener's experience. This proposal aims to delve into the complex world of Taylor Swift's track numbering patterns, highlighting the underlying criteria and artistic choices that define the ordering of her albums. We are expecting that this research will provide us with a better understanding of Swift's creative process, as well as shed light on the importance of track ordering in contemporary music production.

## Objectives:
- Determination of basic features in track numbering
- Developing a model that accurately detects the order of tracks in albums using various features in datasets.
