# Proposal: Analyzing Music Genre Classification and Popularity Trends Across Different Platforms

## Research Question
How do the genres of music used on different platforms affect their popularity?

## Abstract
This research aims to analyze music genre trends across platforms like Spotify and TikTok. It suggests using clustering techniques to group songs based on Spotify features and infer genres. Statistical tests and machine learning models (Random Forest or Gradient Boosting) would then explore the relationship between these genres and TikTok popularity.

## Introduction
This analysis aims to provide insight into how musical elements influence viral trends on social media platforms. We can identify trends in music consumption and popularity across different platforms by comparing data from Spotify and TikTok. This insight can help guide advertising campaigns for companies and artists. Analyzing TikTok's most popular genres can reveal insights into the preferences of younger audiences, which can be useful for targeting niches in the music industry. This approach for genre classification can help to develop machine learning algorithms in music analysis. This might have applications beyond music, such as recommendation systems.
