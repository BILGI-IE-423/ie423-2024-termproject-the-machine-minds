# Project Proposal: Understanding the preferences of Spotify listeners

## Abstract

In the music industry, artists need to comprehend listeners' tastes and the significance of different musical elements to provide truly meaningful material.  Firstly, we want to identify the essential components that lead to the success of modern music by examining characteristics like instrumentalness, liveliness, speechiness, and more. Second, we investigate how a track's mode—major or minor—affects its valence, with a focus on the COVID-19 epidemic. We hope to provide light on how musical tastes have changed throughout time in reaction to world events by investigating how emotional resonance in music may have changed during this time.

## Introduction

In the current digital era, both musicians and business experts must comprehend the complex link that exists between musical elements and consumer preferences.
In light of this, our initiative explores two separate but related questions. First, motivated by the mysterious allure of Taylor Swift's songs, we aim to pinpoint the crucial elements that lead to her albums' commercial success. Through the use of machine learning algorithms and the analysis of several characteristics including instrumentalness, liveliness, speechiness, and more, we hope to unravel the secret recipe of her widely favored works. Second, especially after the COVID-19 outbreak, we want to investigate how a track's mode—major or minor—affects its valence. 
Through the analysis of data from the beginning of the epidemic to the present, we want to identify trends that provide light on the changing emotional terrain of music consumption.

## Objectives

- To determine the essential musical elements—instrumentality, liveliness, speechiness, and more—that add to the high preference ratings of Taylor Swift albums.
- To design machine learning models that can forecast the characteristics that fans of Taylor Swift's music find most appealing, in order to offer producers and musicians useful advice on how to write songs that would be economically successful.
- To examine how a track's mode—major or minor—affects its valence in the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic using a dataset that spans the pandemic's beginning to the present.
- To examine the emotional dynamics of music consumption in the COVID-19 era and identify any appreciable changes in valence trends according to a track's mode, providing an understanding of how listeners' choices have changed in reaction to world events.
