# Project Proposal: Understanding the preferences of Spotify listeners

## Abstract

In the music industry, artists need to comprehend listeners' tastes and the significance of different musical elements to provide truly meaningful material.  Firstly, we want to identify the essential components that lead to the success of modern music by examining characteristics like instrumentalness, liveliness, speechiness, and more. Second, we investigate how a track's mode—major or minor—affects its valence, with a focus on the COVID-19 epidemic. We hope to provide light on how musical tastes have changed throughout time in reaction to world events by investigating how emotional resonance in music may have changed during this time.
