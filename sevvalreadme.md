# Project Proposal: Predicting Song Popularity Using Musical Features

## Abstract

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict song popularity based on specific musical features. Using regression models and advanced algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machines, we aim to uncover fundamental relationships between song features and popularity metrics, providing valuable information for artists, producers, and record labels.

## Introduction

The music industry is constantly evolving, with digital streaming platforms reshaping the way songs are discovered, consumed, and popularized. To predict the success of a song, analysis of various musical features and their impact on listeners' perception is necessary. This project aims to delve into this area to reveal the mechanics of music popularity over the internet using data science techniques.

## Objectives

- Developing predictive models that accurately predict song popularity based on musical features.
- To identify the key determinants of song success.
  
 ## Dataset
 The primary dataset for this project is the "30000 Spotify Songs" dataset.
